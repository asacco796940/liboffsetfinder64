# liboffsetfinder64
A 64bit offsetfinder. It finds offsets, patches, parses Mach-O and even supports IMG4

# This Fork
This fork contains all the changes I made to compile, although I don't remember what all of them were,and therefore it might not work on other machines.

I have not tested it on any other machine than my own, so hopefully it works on yours.

Assuming it does, you should just be able to ```make``` and ```make install```
